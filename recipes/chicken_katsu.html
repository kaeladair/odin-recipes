        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with 
        Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu 
        (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
            <li><strong>Panko:</strong> Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour.</li>
            <li>Coat each chicken breast in egg, then press into the Panko.</li>
